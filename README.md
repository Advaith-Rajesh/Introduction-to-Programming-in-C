## Course Description ##

An intensive course designed to develop logic and programming skills through immersion in the fundamentals of C. Programming projects involving mathematical problems and word games challenge students to develop their logical reasoning, systematic thinking, and problem-solving skills. Students learn the structure and features of a fundamental programming language as they implement solutions in C. In addition to teaching programming techniques, the course will cover an overview of fundamental computing concepts including data structures, library design, and memory management. Labs are carried out in Linux Virtual Machines configured for the class and installed on the student’s personal laptop computer.

### Note ###

Participants are expected to bring laptops and notebooks to class. Laptops can either be a PC or a Mac, but should have 8GB - 10GB of free space.
